# Arduino Minigame

This is a tiny game made for Arduino connected to 3 buttons and 9 LEDs (the display). The 3 buttons control
a spaceship (left, right, shoot) and the 9 LEDs are used as a tiny display. Enemy spaceships come from the bottom
of the screen and try to get up while the player has to stop them.
